<p>The key is F major.</p>
<p>The tempo is 120 bpm.</p>
<p>As context, it's about finding hope to get through negative situations. At the end Tyler Joseph is rapping about unintended consequences. You can often find me down in the forest.</p>
<p>Key lyrics are: "And then when just enough light comes from just the right side and you find you're not who you're supposed to be?" and "My tree house is on fire and for some reason I smell gas on my hands. This is not what I had planned. This is not what I had planned."
