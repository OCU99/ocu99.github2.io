<p>The key is A flat minor.</p>
<p>The tempo is 135 bpm.</p>
<p>It's about hiding your emotions and the effect that can have. The meaning behind clear is somewhat unclear. I think that's why the name itself is ironic.</p>
<p>Key lyrics are: "I wish that I had two faces to prove which theory works. Yelling on the street corner or cleverly masking your words." and "Where's your home? Where're you going and why're you here? Have you asked these questions? Have you been sincere?"
